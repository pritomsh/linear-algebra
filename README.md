# Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and Tensors
<details>
<summary>Scalers</summary>
A scaler is just a single  number, in contrast to most of the other objects studied in linear algebra, which are usually arrays of tmultiple numbers. It's write in italies and lower-case variable.  “Let n ∈ N be the number of units,” while defining a natural number scalar.

<details>
<summary>Matrices</summary>
A matrix is a 2-D array of numbers, so each element is identified by two indices instead of just one.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Vectors</summary>
A vector is an array of numbers. The numbers are arranged in order.we write them as a column enclosed in square brackets
</details>

<details>
<summary>Tensors</summary>
An array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a variable number of axes is known as a tensor.an array with more than two axes.

# Multiplying Matrices
Condider 2 matriecs M1 and M2. For matriecs multiply M1 must have the same number of columns as M2 has rows. If M1 is of shape a × b and M2 is of shape b × c, then M is of shape a × c.
